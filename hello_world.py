#First I will create a variable called 'name' this will store the first input.
#From this the user will be prompted to enter their name.
#The print function is used to output the users name.
#After this we use the same concept but now age is the variable which will be stored as an input.
#The user will be prompted to enter their age, and the print function will print the users age.
#Finally the last command will print the string Hello World!

name = input("Please enter your name?")
print (name)
age = input("Please enter your age")
